A small program that can help in figuring out blackjack and side-bet payouts.

Made by me to help me drill blackjack, mixed pair, coloured pair, and perfect pair payouts as part of my job as a casino table game dealer.

Whether this program helps anyone else is down to how their place of work is run. YMMV.
